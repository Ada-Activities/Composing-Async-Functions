# Composing Async Functions

Activity for Calling APIs Asynchronously

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this project.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

## Running the REPL

1. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

2. Open the project in VS Code

   ```bash
   $ code .
   ```

3. Make edits to the `src/index.js` file.

4. Run the REPL.

  - In the terminal from the project directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ node src/index.js
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```

  - Or from VS Code, install the **Code Runner** extension and run the file by clicking the play button in the top right corner of the editor.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 as needed.

## Syntax Warnings

The project is configured to use ESLint to provide syntax warnings. ESLint can be run from the project directory using the following command:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

ESLint warnings can be shown in VS Code by installing the **ESLint** extension.

## Additional files

Additional files can be added to the `src` directory and then run from the project directory as

```bash
$ node src/<filename>.js
```

Generally, we can run a file by using the command

```bash
$ node path/to/file.js
```

Where `path/to/file.js` is the path to the file we want to run relative to the current directory.
